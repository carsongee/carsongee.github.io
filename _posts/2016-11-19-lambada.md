At [Superpedestrian](https://superpedestrian.com) we have really
gotten into using AWS lambdas for ETL, batch processing, and other
scheduled tasks, so I created
[Lambada](https://lambada.readthedocs.io) as a nice framework for
making collections of them inside a single repo with `build` time
configuration via environment variables.

Lambdas work great, are basically free, and have all sorts of great
triggers.  There are even interesting Web frameworks like
[Chalice](https://github.com/awslabs/chalice) coming out, but what it
lacks, at least for Python, is a nice way to package, manage
dependencies, and bunch them together since they tend to be small and
bunches of them share code.  The nice part is that Rackspace already
created a nice package and deployment system through
[Lambda Uploader](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lambda-uploader), so
all that was really left was for me to make a framework for grouping
them together in a single repo/project along with a way to do security
sensitive configuration at build time via environment variable
injection or yaml file.

Lambada lets you use decorators similar to
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), to have one project with multiple
Lambda functions in that can all be tested, run, and uploaded with a
command line interface. The
[quick start guide](http://lambada.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quickstart)
has more details, but basically, you can make a file that looks like:

```python
from lambada import Lambada

chart = Lambada(
    handler='fouronthefloor.chart',
    role='arn:aws:iam:xxxxxxx:role/lambda',
    region='us-west-2',
    timeout=60,
    memory=128
)

@chart.dancer
def test_lambada(event, context):
    print('Event: {}'.format(event))


@chart.dancer(
    name='high_memory_test',
    memory=1024,
    requirements=['requirements.txt', 'xtra_requirements.txt']
)
def cool_oneoff(event, context):
    print('Wow, so much memory! extra reqs!')


@chart.dancer(memory=512, timeout=5)
def bob_loblaw(event, _):
    print('Such a great reference!')
```

and with a single `lambada upload` command create three lambdas in
your AWS account with different requirements on time, memory, aws
region, and even software dependencies.
