  Ok, probaby not really a whole new me, but after 6 years, it is time
  for a little rebranding.  Enter `Carson Gee - ClippedCompound`, and
  welcome to the retro-future.

I think the last time I redesigned this site was around 2010.  That is
pretty much a lifetime ago at this point.  I live in a new city, and
I've had three different jobs since then. I've also picked about about
half a dozen new hobbies, and yet the old spinning circle nav stayed
through all that (and don't forget about emojis).

It was pretty cool, still is, but sometimes you just have to change
for the sake of change.  So welcome to the new terminal version of the
site.  I've basically removed all of blog entries except the last one
which is almost two years old because life is short, and I don't need to
be reminded of that thing I did, with that technology that used to
matter.

So here we are: a little leaner, a little less user friendly (I'll
keep working on that), and a lot more retro.

Enjoy the high minded concept with the questionable execution due to
time constraints.

üèé‚òÄÔ∏èout!
