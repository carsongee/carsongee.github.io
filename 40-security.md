##### (Security)

My education and interests have always involved aspects of
security. I've been involved in digital forensics, intrusion detection
and prevention, network access control, vulnerability assessment, and
configuration auditing and standardization. There are thousands of
security tools that change near daily, but when it comes down to it,
information assurance is the process of risk management.

My approach is to ask what the availability, integrity, and
confidentiality properties of a system are, measuring the risk, and
creating processes to address those needs. Not simply "You need to
install a brand X firewall". Because of that approach and the wide set
of systems I've seen, I'm familar with many of the security tools
around, but primarily as a side effect of the process.
