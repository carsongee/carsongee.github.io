##### (Design)

Just that word makes me smile. Design. When it comes to interfaces and
software usability, I've been obsessed for fifteen years. Since my
first personal Website from my local ISP back in 1995, I've always
driven myself to refine Websites, photos, desktop applications, and
pretty much anything else to get the most out of them.
