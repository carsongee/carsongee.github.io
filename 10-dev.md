# Dev

I have been programming in various languages for over fifteen
years. In that time, I've written just about every class of software
around. I've developed Web, server, client, embedded, mobile, and
desktop applications.

Writing software is my passion. Whether I've been employed in
security, system administration, Web design, or even as ski resort
worker; I've been making software constantly since I was 15 years old.

## Projects

Much more than just language, development is all about the design,
requirements gathering, and implementation of projects. These are some
projects I've enjoyed working on over the years.

### Open Source Projects

  <dd>
    Enhancement application for the edX platform that allows system
    administrators and course teams the ability to run arbitrary
    scripts against course data (through command line or LTI/Web
    interface) and have the results delivered to their course's
    dashboard.
  </dd>

    <a href="http://formunculous.org">Formunculous</a> <span>[Creator/Maintainer]</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A Python/Django based application for creating and managing Web
    forms using a simple drag and drop based interface.  It also has
    great form submission review facilities that include CSV exports
    and graphs of form responses.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="http://mac-ro-knife.sourceforge.net/">Mac-Ro-Knife</a>
    <span>[Creator/Maintainer]</span></dt>
  <dd>
    Java based desktop application SSH macro tool. This software is
    used for running simple command line based macros on multiple
    hosts running SSH. It provides remote scripting to multiple
    platforms via SSH (i.e. change your password on 20 systems
    automatically).
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/audiom/">AudioM</a>
    <span>[Creator/Maintainer]</span></dt>
  <dd>
    Java based desktop utility. AudioM takes audio play list formats
    (M3U,PLS,PLA/PLP) and copies the files to a new location with a
    play list matching the new location. It also does play list format
    conversion. Great for managing disk based MP3 players (Especially
    the Sansa).
  </dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="http://posh.codeplex.com">Powershell Framework</a>
    <span>[Creator/Maintainer]</span></dt>
  <dd>
    The Powershell Framework makes running Powershell scripts
    simple. It provides a means of interactively or non-interactively
    running scripts in a simple manner. It provides a form based
    interface to browse and run scripts, and a clean framework for
    writing multithreaded GUI runnable scripts.

### Closed Source Projects

In addition to public open source software contributions, I have
worked as developer on several projects as a contractor and full
time employee.  Here are some of the highlights:

- Backend application for handling large amounts of sensor data
  from mobile apps.
- Set of manufacturing scripts for linking inventory, shipping, and updating
  Web backend.
- E-commerce system for managing event registration fees.
- Major update to a Web application for the planning, approval, and
  recording of milestones towards getting a graduate degree.
- Custom content management suites, calendars, and product gallery
  applications for clients.
- Web based Project management application for multi-team time and
  task tracking.
- Custom e-commerce applications for various clients.
- Human resources Web application for managing applicants, interviews,
  notes, etc.  Primarily targeted at recruiters and head hunters.
- Desktop application for team based logging of current activities
  by each team member.
- LynxOS embedded software research project for automated content
  scrubbing for aircraft control systems and classified information
  handling systems.
- Early Cisco VoIP desk phone application prototyping.
