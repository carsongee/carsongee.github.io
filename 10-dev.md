# Dev

##### (Development)

I have been programming in various languages for over fifteen
years. In that time, I've written just about every class of software
around. I've developed Web, server, client, embedded, mobile, and
desktop applications.

Writing software is my passion. Whether I've been employed in
security, system administration, Web design, or even as ski resort
worker; I've been making software constantly since I was 15 years old.

## Projects

Much more than just language, development is all about the design,
requirements gathering, and implementation of projects. These are some
projects I've enjoyed working on over the years.

worked as developer on several projects as a contractor and full
time employee.  Here are some of the highlights:
