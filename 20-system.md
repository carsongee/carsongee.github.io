# Sys

##### (System Administration)

I live for building and maintaining servers.  It is just plain cool.
It is something I've been enamored with since I built my first server
in primary school.  Architecting solutions and selecting the tools and
systems required to make them happen is what wakes me up in the middle
of the night.

The ability to provide a remote service that increases people's
productivity through automation and availability is something I do
well.  Through my background in software development I know how
systems really work under the hood.  This plus years of experience in
extremely diverse environments give me the capability to deliver
software and technology that makes digital life better and business
run more efficiently.

## Operating System

The core of system administration, operating systems are what I know.
There is hardly one I haven't at least tried, and I know the most
popular ones forwards and backwards.

## Applications and Servers

Running servers is both my hobby and my profession. Thanks to my
diverse employment background, I've had the privilege of running a
large variety of applications and servers in different environments
from small business to mission critical 99.999% up time enterprise
data centers.
